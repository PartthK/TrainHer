# **TrainHer: Your Personal Self-Defense Companion**

## **Inspiration**
The rising concerns about personal safety, especially among women, inspired us to create **TrainHer**. We wanted to empower individuals with an app that not only educates but also equips them with the tools to handle unsafe situations effectively. Our goal was to create a solution that is accessible, interactive, and focused on prevention through self-defense training.

## **What it does**
**TrainHer** is an all-in-one self-defense app that offers:
- **Interactive Tutorials**: Step-by-step self-defense techniques with video demonstrations.
- **Personalized Learning Paths**: Women can choose what they want to learn based on their specific needs and preferences.
- **Emergency Alert System**: One-tap SOS feature to alert pre-selected contacts with your live location.
- **Safety Tips**: A curated list of personal safety guidelines for various real-life scenarios.
- **Practice Mode**: AI-powered feedback system using your device's camera to guide your technique and improve your skills.
- **Progress Tracking**: Personalized dashboards to monitor training progress over time.
- **Personal Profiles**: Each user has their own profile to track achievements and receive personalized feedback.

## **How we built it**
- **Frontend**: Built using **React** to provide a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Developed with **Python** to handle app logic, data processing, and seamless communication with the database.
- **AI Features**: Utilized **TensorFlow Lite** for pose detection to deliver real-time feedback on self-defense techniques.
- **Database and Authentication**: Integrated with **Firebase** for real-time data storage, user authentication, and secure management of personal profiles.
- **Emergency Features**: Leveraged GPS services and **Twilio API** to implement the SOS alert system and live location tracking.
- **Design**: Created intuitive UI/UX designs using Figma, ensuring ease of use across all devices.

## **Challenges we ran into**
- **Pose Detection Accuracy**: Fine-tuning the AI model for accurate feedback was challenging due to variations in user movements.
- **Custom Learning Paths**: Creating a system where users could select and tailor their training required significant backend logic.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Ensuring reliability of live location tracking and SOS alerts, especially in areas with low connectivity.
- **Time Constraints**: Balancing multiple features and ensuring they worked seamlessly within the timeframe required efficient teamwork.
- **User Testing**: Simulating real-life scenarios to test the emergency features posed logistical and technical challenges.

## **Accomplishments that we're proud of**
- Successfully integrating a progress tracker and personal profile system to make the app engaging and user-focused.
- Developing a fully functional SOS feature with live location tracking and instant notifications.
- Building a dynamic feedback system that provides real-time guidance and helps users improve their self-defense techniques.
- Designing a user-friendly interface that is accessible to users of all technical backgrounds.

## **What we learned**
- How to integrate multiple technologies, including React, Python, and TensorFlow Lite, into a cohesive app.
- The importance of user-focused design to enhance engagement and usability.
- Effective strategies for prioritizing features and resolving technical challenges under tight deadlines.
- The value of combining AI with interactive features to provide a more personalized experience.

## **What's next for TrainHer**
- **Advanced Training Modules**: Adding more in-depth self-defense techniques and personalized learning paths.
- **Wearable Integration**: Enabling integration with smartwatches for faster SOS activation.
- **Community Features**: Introducing a platform where users can share experiences, tips, and encouragement.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Expanding accessibility by supporting multiple languages.
- **Offline Functionality**: Allowing training modules and emergency features to work without an internet connection.
- **Gamification**: Adding badges, rewards, and milestones to make learning more engaging.
